# path_prediction_costmap_layer
This repository contains a Ros2 Nav2 package that uses the costmap to publish and update the expected route of robot. Other robots can subscribe to this layer to make smarter planning decissions without overcomplicating the navigation software system. It is part of my master thesis and of a research paper currently being published.
